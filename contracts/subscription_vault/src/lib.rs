    /// **ADMIN ONLY**: Recover stranded funds from the contract.
    ///
    /// This is an exceptional, tightly-scoped mechanism for recovering funds that have
    /// become inaccessible through normal contract operations. Recovery is subject to
    /// strict constraints and comprehensive audit logging.
    ///
    /// # Security Requirements
    ///
    /// - **Admin Authorization Required**: Only the contract admin can invoke this function
    /// - **Audit Trail**: Every recovery emits a `RecoveryEvent` with full details
    /// - **Protected Balances**: Cannot recover funds from active subscriptions
    /// - **Documented Reasons**: Each recovery must specify a valid `RecoveryReason`
    /// - **Positive Amount**: Amount must be greater than zero
    ///
    /// # Safety Constraints
    ///
    /// This function enforces the following protections:
    /// 1. **Admin-only access** - Requires authentication as the stored admin address
    /// 2. **Valid amount** - Amount must be > 0 to prevent accidental calls
    /// 3. **Event logging** - All recoveries are permanently recorded on-chain
    /// 4. **Limited scope** - Only for well-defined recovery scenarios
    ///
    /// # Recovery Scenarios
    ///
    /// Valid use cases documented in `RecoveryReason`:
    /// - **AccidentalTransfer**: Tokens sent directly to contract by mistake
    /// - **DeprecatedFlow**: Funds stranded by contract upgrades or bugs
    /// - **UnreachableSubscriber**: Cancelled subscriptions with lost keys
    ///
    /// # Governance
    ///
    /// Recovery operations should be subject to:
    /// - Transparent documentation of the stranded fund situation
    /// - Community review or multi-sig approval (external to this contract)
    /// - Post-recovery reporting and verification
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `env` - The contract environment
    /// * `admin` - The admin address (must match stored admin)
    /// * `recipient` - Address to receive the recovered funds
    /// * `amount` - Amount of tokens to recover (must be > 0)
    /// * `reason` - Documented reason for recovery (see `RecoveryReason`)
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(())` - Recovery successful, event emitted
    /// * `Err(Error::Unauthorized)` - Caller is not the admin
    /// * `Err(Error::InvalidRecoveryAmount)` - Amount is zero or negative
    /// * `Err(Error::NotFound)` - Admin address not configured
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// // Recover 100 USDC accidentally sent to contract
    /// client.recover_stranded_funds(
    ///     &admin,
    ///     &treasury_address,
    ///     &100_000000,
    ///     &RecoveryReason::AccidentalTransfer
    /// );
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Events
    ///
    /// Emits `RecoveryEvent` with:
    /// - Admin address
    /// - Recipient address
    /// - Amount recovered
    /// - Recovery reason
    /// - Timestamp
    ///
    /// # Security Notes
    ///
    /// ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This function grants the admin significant power. The admin key
    /// should be:
    /// - Protected by multi-signature or hardware wallet
    /// - Subject to governance oversight
    /// - Used only for documented, legitimate recovery scenarios
    ///
    /// **Residual Risks**:
    /// - A compromised admin key could enable unauthorized fund recovery
    /// - Recovery decisions require human judgment and may be disputed
    /// - Sufficient off-chain governance processes must exist
    ///
    /// **Recommended Controls**:
    /// - Use multi-sig wallet for admin key
    /// - Implement time-locked recovery with challenge period
    /// - Conduct community review before executing recovery
    /// - Maintain public log of all recovery operations
